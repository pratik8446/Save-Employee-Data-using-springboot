Employee Data Management System


Overview:

The Employee Data Management System is a web-based application built using the Spring Boot framework. It aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for managing employee data within an organization. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.

Features
Employee CRUD Operations: Perform basic CRUD operations on employee data, including adding new employees, viewing existing records, updating employee information, and deleting records.

Search and Filter: Easily search for specific employees based on various criteria such as name, department, or job title. Apply filters to streamline the data based on specific attributes.

User Authentication: Secure the application with user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate employee data.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement role-based access control to restrict certain functionalities based on user roles. For example, administrators may have full access, while regular employees may only view their own information.

Audit Trail: Keep a record of all changes made to employee data, including the user responsible for the change and the timestamp of the modification.

RESTful API: Expose RESTful endpoints for interacting with employee data, allowing for integration with other systems or applications.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: The core framework for building the application.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access and persistence using the Java Persistence API.

Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization features.

Hibernate: Used as the JPA implementation for database interactions.

MySQL (or other database): The chosen database for storing employee data.
